Project Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive reporting solution for a financial institution to gain better visibility into its loan portfolio. The solution monitors loan performance based on Loan Status, addressing the lack of real-time, granular insights that limits the institution's ability to make informed decisions and optimize operations.

The goal is to build an interactive grid view report that categorizes loan data by status (e.g., current, late, charged off) and provides key performance metrics to drive data-driven decision-making.

Objective
The objective of this project is to deliver actionable insights into critical lending metrics, including:

Total Loan Applications

Total Funded Amount

Total Amount Received

Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount

MTD Amount Received

Average Interest Rate

Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio

By categorizing loans and offering these insights, the solution will enable stakeholders to:

Identify trends in loan performance

Detect risk early by identifying at-risk loans

Make informed decisions to improve lending efficiency, reduce default rates, and increase overall portfolio health
